# Discord MD
A comprehensive guide to Discord Markdown.

# Introduction

Discord MD is a simple guide to learn the Markdown flavor [Discord](https://discord.com/) uses.

Using this guide, you will be able to learn all the cool formatting offered by Discord that you can use to empower your messages.

While this guide is written specifically for Discord's flavor of markdown, it will also apply, to some extent, to other markdown processors.
