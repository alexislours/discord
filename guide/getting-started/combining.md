# Combining basic styles

You can combine italicise, strikethrough, bold and underline to create text using multiple basic styles.

Example:

\*\*\*This text is bold and italicised\*\*\*

\_\_\~\~this text is strikethrough and underlined\~\~\_\_

Result:

***This text is bold and italicised***

<ins>~~this text is strikethrough and underlined~~</ins>
