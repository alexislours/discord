# Quotes

Starting a line with a greater-than sign and a space (`> `) will create a quote.

Example:

\> This is a quote.

Result:

> This is a quote.

## Multiline quotes

If the text you want to quote spans over multiple lines, you can use a multiline quote by starting the line by three greater-than signs and a space (`>>> `).

Example:

\>\>\> This is a   
multi line   
block quote

Result:

> This is a   
multi line   
block quote
