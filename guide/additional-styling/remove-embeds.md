# Removing Embeds

Links on Discord can generate "embeds" or previews. This behavior can be annoying when you don't want to clutter the chat with it.  
Luckily, embeds can be removed by encapsulating your link with a less-than and greater-than sign (`<` and `>`).

Example:

\<https://alexislours.github.io/discord>
