# Colors
As we saw above, we can use specific languages in [multiline code blocks](/discord/multiline-code) to get syntac highlighting. This can be used to our advantage to get our text in a certain color. Discord uses the Solarized Dark Theme, so there are only 7 colors that are available inside code blocks on top of the default message color.

{: .note}
Languages have keywords that won't respect the colors listed below.

### Grey:

You can get grey by using the brainfuck or bash (start line with #) languages.

### Green:

You can get green by using the CSS or diff (start line with +) languages.

You can get these colors using other languages (see the [list of supported languages](/discord/multiline-code/#supported-languages)) but these 7 are the only ones available on Discord on top of the default text color.
