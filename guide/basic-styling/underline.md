# Underline

{: .caution }
This feature is unique to DFM and will most likely result in bolding the text on other markdown processors. You can use the `<ins>` HTML tags to get a similar result on GitHub.

Encapsulating your text with two underscores (`__`) will make it look <ins>underlined</ins>.

Example:

\_\_Underlined Text\_\_

Result:

<ins>Underlined Text</ins>
