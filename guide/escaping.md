# Escaping
All this formatting is nice, but what if you just wanted to use these symbols or explain to a friend how to use them? 

Worry not! You can do that by adding a backslash (`\`) before a special character.

This is called escaping and it will work on all non alphanumeric (characters that aren't A-z or 1-9)! If you do this, Discord won't apply any styling to the characters.

Example:

\\\*\\\*This text will not be bold\\\*\\\*

Result:

\*\*This text will not be bold\*\*

{: .note}
This can also be used by developers to get the ID of a user, a role or a channel. Adding a backslash before tagging someone will instead reveal their Discord ID.
